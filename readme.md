# Readme File
## Important:
Additional work was done during 2nd commit and 3rd commit outside of git and therefore the third commit introduces a lot of new files and code that is a jump from what was pushed in the second commit. Also, that is another reason for less commits.

## Pages
Website will only contain 4 pages to ensure that there is not too much workload to take and will allow each page to contain advanced HTML, CSS or JavaScript. The following are links to the individual ages:
